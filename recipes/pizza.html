    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Our Margherita pizza isn't just a meal; it's a celebration of simplicity and authentic Italian tradition. Imagine biting into a perfectly crisp yet chewy crust, baked to golden perfection, yielding to the tangy sweetness of sun-ripened San Marzano tomatoes. Each slice is generously adorned with fresh, creamy mozzarella, melting into a luscious blanket, its mild dairy notes harmonizing beautifully with the vibrant tomato. A scattering of fragrant fresh basil leaves adds a final flourish, releasing its aromatic oils as it bakes, completing the iconic tricolor of the Italian flag.</p>
